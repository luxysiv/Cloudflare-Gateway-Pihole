# Pihole styled, but using Cloudflare Gateway
`For Devs, Ops, and everyone who hates Ads.`

Create your ad blocklist using Cloudflare Gateway

### Credit goes there.
---

> First inspired by [IanDesuyo/CloudflareGatewayAdBlock](https://github.com/IanDesuyo/CloudflareGatewayAdBlock).

> Thanks alot to [@nhubaotruong](https://github.com/nhubaotruong) for his contributions.

> Modified by [@minlaxz](https://github.com/minlaxz).
>> Removed unnecessaries: removed `lib` directory and handling inside the github actions.

>> Added dynamic domain filter (whitelist and blacklist) idea (please check `ini` files, as you may also need to modify those.)

### Supported styles
---
* White list [whitelist.ini](whitelist.ini) and
* Two kinds of balcklist [adlist.ini](adlist.ini)

```ini
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdargon/hostsVN/master/option/hosts-VN
```
or
```ini
[Hosts-Urls]
hostsVN = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdargon/hostsVN/master/option/hosts-VN
```


### How to set this up?
---
1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Grab your **Cloudflare Account ID** from ‚ûû `https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers`
3. Create your **API Token** from ‚ûû `https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens` with 3 permissions 
   1. `Account.Zero Trust : Edit` 
   2. `Account.Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit`
   3. `Account.Access: Apps and Policies : Edit`

4. Add **Repository Secrets** to your forked repository
`‚ûû https://github.com/<username>/<forked-repository>/settings/secrets/actions`
   1. Set **Cloudflare Account ID** to `CF_IDENTIFIER`
   2. Set **API Token** to `CF_API_TOKEN`


#### Note
---
> Github Actions: it has 2 dependent backup workflows [re-run](.github/workflows/re-run.yml) and [re-run2]([re-run](.github/workflows/re-run2.yml)) in case if the **[main workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml)** fails, 

> They will retry after 5 minutes one after another only if the **main workflow** has been failed (not cancelled - if you cancelled the main workflow manually, they will not be triggered anyway).

### How to set up using Termux?
---

* Download the **GOAT** [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest)

* Here're `commands` need to be run one after another to setup python

**if you know how to do, you can skip this step.**

```
pkg upgrade
pkg install python-pip
pkg install git
# Clone your forked repo. #
```

* Command to upload (update) your DNS list.
```
python -m src
```
_You may also check this out [termux-change-repo](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management) in case if you run into trouble setting things up._


### Note
---
* The **limit** of `Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust` free is **300k domains** so remember to pay attention to the workflow logs, `if it is exceeded, the script will stop`

* If you have uploaded lists using another script, you should delete them using the delete feature of the uploaded script or delete them manually

* I have updated the feature to delete lists when you no longer need to use the script. Go to [__main__.py](src/__main__.py) as follows:

```python
async def main():
    adlist_urls = read_urls_from_file("adlist.ini")
    whitelist_urls = read_urls_from_file("whitelist.ini")
    adlist_name = "DNS-Filters"
    app = App(adlist_name, adlist_urls, whitelist_urls)
    await app.delete()  # Leave script
    # await app.run()
```

Note from [@minlaxz](https://github.com/minlaxz):
1. Domain list stlye: I personally preferred second one in blacklist styles, which has more readablity and concise.`
2. Dynamic domain list: You can also update your dynamic (fluid) whitelist and blacklist using [dynamic-blacklist.txt](dynamic-blacklist.txt) and [dynamic-whitelist.txt](dynamic-whitelist.txt)
3. Deprected using `.env` : Setting sensitive information inside a public repository is considered too dangerous use-case, since any unwanted person could easily steal your Cloudflare credentials from that `.env` file.
