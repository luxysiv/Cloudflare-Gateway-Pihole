# Setup
Add variables secrets to your forked repository
`https://github.com/<username>/<repository>/settings/secrets/actions`:

* Grab your Account ID from https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers and set to `CF_IDENTIFIER`
* `CF_API_TOKEN` take from : https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with 3 permissions `Account.Zero Trust : Edit` `Account.Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit` `Account.Access: Apps and Policies : Edit`

* Script has 2 backup workflow files that if the upload fails, will run 2 more times every 5 minutes.  So the failure rate will be very low


# Termux

# ChÃº Ã½ 

* Supports using any list

* The limit of Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust free is 300k domains so remember to pay attention to the log, if it exceeds the script will stop

* If you have uploaded lists using another script, you should delete them using the delete feature of the uploaded script or delete them manually
```

* I have updated the feature to delete lists when you no longer need to use the script. Go to [__main__.py](src/__main__.py) as follows:

```python
async def main():
    adlist_urls = read_urls_from_file("adlist.ini")
    whitelist_urls = read_urls_from_file("whitelist.ini")
    adlist_name = "DNS-Filters"
    app = App(adlist_name, adlist_urls, whitelist_urls)
    await app.delete()  # Leave script
    # await app.run()
```

ðŸ‘Œ Wishing you success

ðŸ‘Œ If you have any questions about the script, you can open an issue
