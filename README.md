>> Added dynamic domain filter (whitelist and blacklist) idea (please check `ini` files, as you may also need to modify those).
>>> Added dynamic domain filter (whitelist and blacklist) to Actions variables (please check [dynamic_blacklist.txt](./lists/dynamic_blacklist.txt) and [dynamic_whitelist.txt](./lists/dynamic_whitelist.txt). to know examples to add `Value*`).Use `DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST` and `DYNAMIC_WHITELIST` for `Name*` in Actions variables 

### Supported styles
---
* Two kinds of lists in ini files: white list [whitelist.ini](./lists/whitelist.ini) and block list [adlist.ini](./lists/adlist.ini).

```ini
https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```
or
```ini
[Ad-Urls]
Adguard = https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```

### Custom URLs
---
* Add to file:
  > White list [whitelist.ini](./lists/whitelist.ini) and block list [adlist.ini](./lists/adlist.ini).

* Add to GitHub Action variables:
  > `Name*`
  >> `ADLIST_URLS` or `WHITELIST_URLS`.

  > `Value*` `URLs list`
  >> Example:
  ```text
  https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/light-onlydomains.txt
  ```

* You should add your ad list and whitelist to Action variables. If you update your fork, your custom list will not be lost.

### How to set this up?
---
1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Grab your **Cloudflare Account ID** (found after `https://dash.cloudflare.com/`) from ‚ûû https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers.
3. Create your **API Token** from ‚ûû https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with 3 permissions:
   1. `Account.Zero Trust : Edit`
   2. `Account.Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit`
   3. `Account.Access: Apps and Policies : Edit`

4. Add **Repository Secrets** to your forked repository:
`‚ûû https://github.com/<username>/<forked-repository>/settings/secrets/actions`
   1. Set **Cloudflare Account ID** to `CF_IDENTIFIER`.
   2. Set **API Token** to `CF_API_TOKEN`.
---
* The **limit** of `Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust` free is **300k domains**, so remember to pay attention to the workflow logs. If it is exceeded, the script will stop.

* If you have uploaded lists using another script, you should delete them using the delete feature of the uploaded script or delete them manually.

* I have updated the feature to delete lists when you no longer need to use the script. Go to [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) as follows:

```yml
      - name: Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust 
        run: python -m src leave
```

Note from [@minlaxz](https://github.com/minlaxz):
1. Domain list style: I personally preferred the second one in blacklist styles, which is more readable and concise.
2. Dynamic domain list: You can also update your dynamic (fluid) whitelist and blacklist using [dynamic_blacklist.txt](./lists/dynamic_blacklist.txt) and [dynamic_whitelist.txt](./lists/dynamic_whitelist.txt).
3. Deprecated using `.env`: Setting sensitive information inside a public repository is considered too dangerous, since any unwanted person could easily steal your Cloudflare credentials from that `.env` file.
